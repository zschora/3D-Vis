// Package geom provides geometric primitives for 2D and 3D modeling and visualization.
//
// The package includes:
//   - 2D and 3D coordinate systems (Coords2d, Coords3d)
//   - Vertex types for 2D and 3D points
//   - Vector types with mathematical operations (dot product, cross product, normalization)
//   - Mesh structures for representing 3D models with vertices and faces
//   - Predefined 3D primitives (CreateCube, CreateTetrahedron)
//
// All geometric operations use floating-point arithmetic with a default tolerance
// (DefaultTolerance) for equality comparisons to handle floating-point precision issues.
